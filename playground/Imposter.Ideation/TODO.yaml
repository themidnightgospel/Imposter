Constraints:
  - Minimize reflection
  - Target C# 7.0

FEATURES:
  HIGH:
    IN Progress:
      - Generic method support
      - Generic interface support
    NOT Started:
      - Async method support - Not Started
      - Property setup support
      - Indexer setup support
      - Event setup support
      - Impostering class (abstract class, virtual methods)
      - Make imposter thread safe
      - Put method related types in a sub-class of Imposter class, that way we won't have to repeat generics every time and less things to worry about for naming collisions.
      - In ImposterTargetInstance, custom members like _imposter might collide with interface member names

  MEDIUM:
    - NOT Started:
        - Add <auto-generated /> comment at the beggining
        - TODO Use cancellation token during code generation
        - Go thru all the SyntaxFactory builder classes, like ClassDeclaration and replace with custom builders.

  LOW:
    - NOT Started:
        - Support for 'scoped' parameters

OPTIMIZATIONS:
  - Need to make sure that every name in imposter class has unique name and does not collide with user provided names 
  - Create syntax builder classes to avoid .With builder methods that has terribe performance (add tests for this too)
  - Identify syntaxes that can be cached
  - Add benchamrks for the code generator itself.
  - Add benchamrks for syntax builder classes, showcase that it performs better than built-in .With methods.
