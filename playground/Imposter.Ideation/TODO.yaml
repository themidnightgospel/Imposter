Constraints:
  - Minimize reflection
  - Target C# 7.0

FEATURES:
  HIGH:
    Done:
      - Generic method support
      - Async method support
      - Generic interface support - for closed generics
      - Property
        - Returns single and multiple values
        - Setter callback's
        - Setup property to act as a normal property (when set, same value is read). Support for initial value
        - Setup all properties (move to an interface as explicit implementation)
        - Verify set
      - Put method related types in a sub-class of Imposter class, that way we won't have to repeat generics every time and less things to worry about for naming collisions. - DONE
    IN Progress:
      - Indexer setup support
    NOT Started:
      - Event setup support
      - Impostering class (abstract class, virtual methods)
      - Make imposter thread safe
      - In ImposterTargetInstance, custom members like _imposter might collide with interface member names - DONE
      - Use fully qualified name wherever possible
      - For c# 14, declare Impsoter as an extension to imposter target type
      - Make sure metadata structs are passed as readonly
      - fix TODOs in code
      - cleanup SyntaxFactoryHelper
      - Setup github action to build, test and publish nuget packages
      - Add Wiki page

  MEDIUM:
    - NOT Started:
        - Add <auto-generated /> comment at the begginning
        - TODO Use cancellation token during code generation
        - Go thru all the SyntaxFactory builder classes, like ClassDeclaration and replace with custom builders.
        - Add support for Strict and Loose modes
        - Add support for open generic imposters. Example, `[GenerateImposter(typeof(IGenericSut<,>))]`
        - Proper diagnostics
        - NOTE / To avoid namign collision, rename parameters in Invoke/Set methods instead of internal fields/methods

  LOW:
    - NOT Started:
        - Support for 'scoped' parameters
        - Add unit tests for InterfaceSymbolExtensions

OPTIMIZATIONS:
  - Need to make sure that every name in imposter class has unique name and does not collide with user provided names 
  - Create syntax builder classes to avoid .With builder methods that has terribe performance (add tests for this too)
  - Identify syntaxes that can be cached
  - Add benchamrks for the code generator itself.
  - Add benchamrks for syntax builder classes, showcase that it performs better than built-in .With methods.
  - Take a look at file name convention, specially of "Builders" and make sure they are consistent across
  - Make sure Metadata is always stack allocated and not copied

MISSING FEATURES:
  - VerifyNoOtherCalls
  - Ordered verification, Substitute.InOrder. It can be achieved currently by setting up callbacks and storing some flags in a list.
